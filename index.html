I honestly hadn't had time over the holiday to create the homework but I wanted to submit at least a Psudocode with some steps I would've taken. 

1. Create an interface and some sections where the information could be uploaded to and add some style to it. 
2. I would then look for a weather API online and look at the documentation of it so that I know what arrays I am pullling out of. 
3. Create a Ajax "Get" to obtain the information and then update the DOM at its specific location.
